            <p>The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a
                global call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure
                prosperity for all by 2030. Despite significant progress, the complexity
                and interconnected nature of these goals necessitate innovative, cross
                sectoral approaches. There is a need to look into the current practices,
                approaches, challenges and future strategies adopted across the globe. 
               This conference aims to bring together experts from various disciplines
                to analyze, discuss, deliberate on relevant issues and generate new
                strategies for achieving the SDGs. </p>
